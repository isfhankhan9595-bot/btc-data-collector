# Execution Status

Engineering ledger for the BTC market-data collector. This file records what
has actually been verified against source, not what was intended.

**Rule for this file:** a phase is only marked COMPLETE when implementation,
tests, adversarial tests and documentation all exist and the suite passes.
Documentation is never a substitute for implementation.

## Repository baseline (audited 2026-09-18)

| Item | Finding |
|---|---|
| Authoritative branch | `main` @ `fd5341c` (merge of PR #2) |
| Merged PRs | #1 (Phase 2 storage contract), #2 (Phase 3 runtime integrity) |
| Open PRs | #3 (`claude-test-pr`) — unrelated test PR, not project work |
| Stale branches | `phase-3-fixes` (superseded by `phase-3-runtime-integrity`) |
| Test baseline on `main` | **3 failing**, 170 passing |
| CI | None. Only a destructive one-shot importer workflow. |

### Baseline defects found on `main`

| # | Defect | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | `datetime` timestamp (schema-legal) raised `TypeError` in `_close_segment`, killing the ingest task after publication | **High** — data/process loss | Fixed (Phase 0) |
| D2 | `_next_sequence` rescanned the stream directory on every hour rollover | Medium — hot-path O(files) | Fixed (Phase 0) |
| D3 | `import-collector.yml` could clone the upstream trading-bot repo and force-push over `main`, destroying Phase 2/3 work | **Critical** — repo loss | Removed (Phase 0) |
| D4 | No CI: nothing ran tests on push or PR | High | Fixed (Phase 0) |
| D5 | `collector.collector.utils` hard-imported repo-root `telegram_bot`, making the package unimportable standalone | **High** — architecture | Fixed (Phase 0) |
| D6 | `GapDetector.check_gap` notified *before* committing `last_seen`; a raising notifier permanently corrupted gap tracking | Medium — silent corruption | Fixed (Phase 0) |
| D7 | `datetime.utcnow()` (deprecated, naive) used for hour bucketing | Low | Fixed (Phase 0) |

### Known outstanding defects (carried forward, not yet fixed)

| # | Defect | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| D8 | `scripts/gap_report.py` computes coverage as `(total_ms - gap_ms)/total_ms`. A stream with three observations one second apart reports **100% coverage**. Pre-first-observation and post-last-observation periods are not counted. This is a false-clean report. | 21/22 |
| D9 | `scripts/replay_test.py` is not a replay engine. It loads a derived Parquet file and asserts bounds on columns. There is no recorded-clock replay, no raw event source, no determinism check. | 8 |
| D10 | No raw wire capture layer. `binance_orderbook_raw` stores normalised levels, not exact payloads; there is no connection id, no REST request/response lineage. Deterministic replay is not currently possible from stored data. | 6 |
| D11 | OKX adapter declares `trades`, `mark-price`, `index-tickers`, `open-interest`, `funding-rate`, `liquidation-orders` in `channel_event_types` but `normalize()` only implements `books`. Everything else silently returns `[]`. | 14 |
| D12 | Bybit adapter merges ticker deltas into shared `_ticker_state` and emits merged values without marking which fields were carried forward. Staleness is not observable. | 13 |
| D13 | WebSocket reconnect backoff has no jitter; no maximum retry cap; no recovery deduplication. | 23 |
| D14 | `binance_snapshot_bridge` and the USD-M sequence rules are implemented from assumption and have not been re-verified against current official Binance documentation. | 4 |

## Phase ledger

### Phase 0 — Repository baseline and integrity — **COMPLETE**

- **Branch:** `phase-00-baseline-integrity`
- **Objective:** make the repository buildable, testable, standalone and safe
  to work in before any feature work.
- **Changes:**
  - Segment metadata timestamps normalised to epoch ms (`_epoch_ms`), so a
    schema-legal `datetime` no longer destroys the ingest task.
  - Post-publication metadata failure is now a durable
    `STORAGE_METADATA_FAILED` quality event instead of a fatal exception.
  - `_next_sequence` performs one directory scan and caches every logical
    hour; collision semantics preserved and kept hour-local.
  - Removed the destructive `import-collector.yml` workflow.
  - Added a read-only `ci.yml` running compile, import and test checks.
  - New `collector/collector/notifications.py`: optional, injectable,
    fail-open notification backend. Collector no longer hard-imports
    `telegram_bot`.
  - `GapDetector` commits state before notifying and guards the notifier.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_phase0_storage_integrity.py` (13),
  `tests/test_phase0_standalone.py` (5).
- **Suite:** 191 passed, 0 failed.

### Phases 1+ — NOT STARTED

Dependency order and remaining scope are tracked in the defect table above
(D8–D14). No later phase may be marked complete on the strength of a plan.
